# Privacy Policy for Caissa

**Last Updated:** February 15, 2026

## Introduction
Caissa ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## Information We Collect

### 1. Account Information
When you sign up, we collect your email address and authentication credentials via **Firebase Authentication** to secure your account and sync your data across devices.

### 2. Gameplay and Usage Data
We collect data related to your chess games, including:
- Game moves (PGN)
- Analysis results
- Journal entries and notes
This data is stored securely in **Google Firestore** and locally on your device to provide the App's core functionality.

### 3. Generative AI Features
We use Google Gemini and other AI models to provide features such as:
- **Game Analysis:** Analyzing your chess games to identify mistakes and key moments.
- **AI Coach:** Generating personalized training advice and explanations.
- **Interactive Chat:** Answering your chess-related questions.

When you use these features, the relevant game data (PGN, moves) and your queries are processed by our AI providers. This data is used solely to generate the response and is not used to train public AI models.

### 4. Purchase Information
We use **RevenueCat** to manage subscriptions. RevenueCat collects purchase history and subscription status linked to an anonymous App User ID. We do not process or store your credit card or payment information directly; all transactions are handled by Apple's App Store.

- **RevenueCat:** For subscription management.

## Your Rights
